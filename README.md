# weather_sphere

Weather Sphere is a simple mobile weather app written in Flutter.  It fetches weather data from Open Weather Map to provide a brief 5-day forecast for a given location.  The
location can either be retrieved using location services from the device, or the user can specify a location by name.  To help personalize the app, the 
user can setup a custom background by choosing an image file on their device.
